On one hand, it&#39;s an incredibly enjoyable movie watching experience with unparalleled visual effects, just all around top notch Sci fi. But on the other hand, it&#39;s preachy and problematic.  Like, the movie is pretty much a blue faced scifi reskin of those native american environmentalist adds from the 70s.  While not explicitly a racist characature, the entire trope of the noble native magically in tune with nature is not only overdone, it can trace its routes to racist stereotypes.  It&#39;s the movie equivalent of a cartoon native mascot."

Even though Avatar is like a baton over the head with its message, the way you\u2019re suggesting that the humans maybe aren\u2019t bad is weird. Humans ARE the villains in this story. Regardless of their tech maybe being able to help. <br><br>The humans in Avatar attempted to colonize a planet, destroyed it in the process, then essentially forced the indigenous population to just accept their intrusion (example: like having to overlook humans hunting creatures that had significant social and spiritual value to them AND were sentient, social, intelligent beings). <br><br>The weakness in the writing isn\u2019t because it doesn\u2019t use the \u201cboth sides\u201d approach. It\u2019s the drawn out basic white savior narrative (Jake falling in love, saving them, AND inheritance of leadership. And whatever weird Kiri/Grace reincarnation and she gets special favor from their deity), lack of real conflict, and character dynamics that aren\u2019t explored."

The Na&#39;vi don&#39;t do war crimes because they aren&#39;t like humans, they&#39;re enlightened. This is a superior way to live, look at our world, the toll that industrial society took on our souls. Read Ted Kaczynski&#39;s manifesto and you may understand why Avatar is by far my favourite film series.<br><br>All of your points as to why you think it&#39;s &#39;stupid&#39; are scenes that I thoroughly enjoyed and not just as mindless escapism. The witch doctor scene for example, it&#39;s set up that Eywa is very real, that&#39;s a rule that this scene followed, is it so hard to believe that it&#39;s not necessarily propaganda for alternative medicine but rather an aesthetic choice for a fantasy world? I just think it&#39;s subjective as to how good it is."

Jake would then be sympathetic to them, as he completely understands having to do what you must (either through humanities general dystopian nature or his disability) but has to keep himself from helping them so he can maintain his connections with the Navi. <br><br>Then when Jake betrays humanity, humanity chooses to ally with the brutal Navi and give them powerful weapons and creatures from different parts of Pandora. I imagine a scene where the old soldier guy bonds with the brutal Navi chieftain (who would be a young and woefully inexperienced person) about having to do the right thing.<br><br>Like,<br>&quot;You&#39;ve done some terrible things, haven&#39;t you son?&quot;<br>&quot;You speak of what you do not know!&quot;<br>&quot;Oh, but I do. We all do. Every human here knows the pain of doing what has to be done, and the shame and loathing that brings.&quot;<br><br>The last scene with them would be Jake trying to convince the Chieftain to retreat or change sides or something, which then leads to:<br>&quot;You dare?! We stand at the precipice of greatness! Those who despised us, hunted us, who tore down our home and drove us from our lands, are now weak and vulnerable! Our allies have granted us power beyond anything we have ever known, and we know ride beasts from legend! And you <b>DARE</b> demand me to return to the old way? Where our children died of starvation and sickness, where we had to force our beasts to our will?! Never again! Today, the [ Brutal Navi ] rise! And we will never fall again!&quot;"

        "Comments snippet-text": "People don\u2019t love it for the story. They only love it for the cgi. 2009, was pretty understandable because compare Avatar to other movies during that time and you\u2019d think that Avatar was made in 2016 or something, but no. It was 2009 and many people were very shocked. But now the sequel isn\u2019t anything that special. Sure, Disney\u2019s cgi might\u2019ve gotten bad, but Avatar 2\u2019s cgi isn\u2019t better than cgi today. It\u2019s comparable but people had the same reaction people did in 2009. But yet they can never tell you what these two movies are about, yet if you say that it\u2019s basically a \u201chuman bad nature good\u201d story or like Pocahontas (which is basically is), all those same people who couldn\u2019t remember the story, will be quick to say how that\u2019s \u201cnot true\u201d or how it has a \u201cdeeper\u201d story than we think. I hate it. So overall, I don\u2019t think people \u201chate\u201d Avatar, but more just manage to see right through it\u2019s obvious main attraction: the cgi. Not the story"

Second, I think you used a unfair argument, even though your points about shallow characters and superficial criticism are valid. It&#39;s not like all natives groups were war people, cannibalistic or whatnot. The Na&#39;vi could be perfectly inspired on one of those peaceful groups and the story still would be valid, since the same opression by the colonizer happened with all tribes, whether they were chill or not. And their people were not perfect, far from that. We saw Sully&#39;s family mistreat and kinda forget about one of their members, Spider (probably because he was a human and son of the villain, but he is not to blame). They didn&#39;t hesitate in threat his life when a &quot;real member&quot; was in danger. Also, they were harassed be the water nation as well (Sully&#39;s kids were discriminated by teens for being mixed and for being from another place). How can that be not mentioned? Having a society with flaws doesn&#39;t mean that they needed to be monsters. Things could have been as you suggested, but the way it was as definitely not wrong either. Even the human were humanized, since the villain showed love towards his kid and there was a good scientist among them."

        "Comments snippet-text": "Before I start watching this video, I&#39;d like to share my opinions on the Avatar franchise. <br>(SPOILERs aHEAD FOR AVATAR 2)<br>Avatar was one of my favourite films due to the beauty of the world the movie has created, I love the design of the planet, the mysterious life forces, such and such etc. Because I was so fond of this first movie and I realized this movie was going to have a sequel with new Na&#39;vi tribes being introduced, I was excited. I was looking forward to see how these tribes would be united to defeat the bad force once again, and I foolishly believed that the writing, the story, would be as good as the amount of effort in rendering the movie was going to be.<br>Avatar 2 was majorly disappointing to me. The graphics are beautiful, and I think no one is there to debate about that (except maybe for the face capture on one of the protagonist&#39;s daughters who has unexplained life magic, which was ugly and really off putting). But the story was absolutely disappointing. There&#39;s no better word to express my feelings on this movie, and the fact that I used disappointing twice should show that already.<br>The story was very cheap and leaves the audience with more questions, and the technology has been previously established in the last movie about how much it can do, however the main villain is fucking resurrected??? As a Na&#39;vi???? Despite his corpse never retrieved on Pandora??? I watched both movies, and I don&#39;t remember any explanation for that. In addition to this cheesy main villain resurrection because no other fuck could&#39;ve been the villain I guess, the return of humanity coming back to do the same fucking thing is ridiculous. It makes sense, until the ships land again as if the message hasn&#39;t been learned. Thinking about it now, the movie should&#39;ve kept all the bases in space so that they&#39;d have an advantage on preparation, as space is untouched by Na&#39;vi.<br>Anyway, half-way through the movie it&#39;s all about the protagonists family, adjusting a new life... because bad guys are going to reach the floating rocks (AKA previous home) somehow. The move is understandable, for family concerns, and so is the protagonists wife&#39;s reaction, being angrry at having to move. But I noticed throughout the movie, that the protagonist, being a male, does not cry, and is very masculine, or &quot;Alpha Male&quot; for a simple description of his actions and reactions throughout the film. The wife was very emotional and feral like, animalistic, which I do not agree with because in the previous movie and even this one she is clearly good at fighting and reasoning, and to have her overly emotional in some parts was just annoying.<br>Not to mention the kids being kidnapped at least 3+ times just to move the plot forward, in addition to NONE of them getting traumatized. Like wtf???? Any kid would be fucking terrified to be held at gunpoint and they return to be kidnapped???? And then that one scene where the youngest boy bonds with a whale and the whale T-poses just has me rolling on the floor. Yes, that might be metaphorical or something, but you can&#39;t tell me a T-posing whale is funny af and kinda lazy- I don&#39;t have much experience in Blender (3D modelling platform) yet I can also T-pose a whale like that easily.<br>And that kid with life powers is so fucking unexplained like???? What was the point of that? That&#39;s just inserting a Mary Sue into the film.<br>Finally, we get to the end. Everything&#39;s on fire and kids save the day, mom threatened to kill her adopted fucking son (human) in exchange for the villain to stop killing her son/daughter can&#39;t remember which one which definitely should&#39;ve traumatized Spider (the son)???? Like she <b>cut</b> his throat, blood clearly appeared there, and despite the villain being evil and everything when everyone was underwater trapped by the giant ship Spider SAVES HIM, AND RETURNS TO THE FAMILY WITH THE MOTHER WHO THREATENED AND ACTUALLY ALMOST KILLED HIM. AND IS HAPPY???<br>I remember in the trailer of this movie that thee protagonist was going around tribes asking for help. I was expecting a war, a united world against the Sky People. But instead I got Sully pretending to be a native (which is kinda insulting) and very masculine, his wife being just there, the unnecessary amount of children and their kidnapping and worst of all, resurrection of the villain established dead (and now also saved for fucking later movies).<br>A message about &#39;stop environmental destruction&#39; again was better than this shit family trauma that doesn&#39;t even make sense or even give answers to the questions risen. I bet all these questions answers are saved for the next movie, which is an absolute shit move. The world had large potential; but the story/plot was absolutely shit and as the saying goes, a few bad apples spoil the bunch."

        "Comments snippet-text": "One point I don&#39;t often see addressed with Avatar and it&#39;s sequel is how fundamentally <b>unequal</b> the situation between the Na&#39;vi and Humans is.  The Na&#39;vi have a sort of god that is literally a god, that looks after all life, and apparently even affords some sort of afterlife to the Na&#39;vi.  The all seem to have perfect heath, no dental carries, no congenital deformities, no bad eyesight, no hemophilia.  Evidently there are no famines or plagues either.  But we poor humans have no god, or at least not one who seems to look after us.  We starve, we catch Ebola, we are drowned in floods, freeze in blizzards, get eaten wolves and die helplessly when nature is indifferent to our welfare.  So can humanity be blamed we are merely the cast-off, unwanted children of the universe, battling for survival?  One other point ... am I the only person who finds repeated scenes of large numbers of identical Na&#39;vi singing praise in ecstasy  to their All Powerful Tree God to be rather creepy?  ...not spiritually uplifting?"

I don&#39;t need to hear arguments for why Odysseus is actually the bad guy for freeing his men from the Cyclops.  It&#39;s okay to have villains in a story.<br><br>I agree that it is better to have a thorough examination, theoretically, and I enjoy many complex plots and characters myself.  But it&#39;s literally wrong to say that a story needs that sort of complexity to be good.<br><br>These self-aware moral analyses appeal to the liberal&#39;s common sense of &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot; and the good of the individual as the opposite of the evil of society.  I like that stuff.  But a black and white moral split absolutely works in its own right.<br><br>Does that make Avatar good?  No.  But I think it&#39;s very difficult to make demands of an entire art form (storytelling, in this case) to conform to any aesthetic universal.  Not impossible, but extremely difficult to justify.<br><br>Lots of people didn&#39;t like Avatar, but a very considerable number of people did like it.  That doesn&#39;t dictate quality, but it does suggest it.<br><br>I agree with an overwhelming majority of your opinions.  That one just sits wrong with me."

The movie never pretends to be something more than this, it&#39;s visual effects are front and center.

Looking at the characters in this movie is an inheritely flawed way to watch it, since Jake Sully is merely a vessel for us to experience the spectacle and get to know the real main character, which is Pandora.<br>The character&#39;s are so basic and non-consequential that they ressurected the villain for the second movie. I watched the second movie in the cinema WITH NO BREAKS. Nearly pissed myself holding it in and my legs cramped up multiple times. I stayed through it all, not getting up, not because I might miss a character beat for Jake Sully, but because I didn&#39;t want to miss any of Pandora&#39;s beauty or any of the great visual effects work."

Its not a foreign idea in media to see the protagonists&#39; as symbol for pure good. I myself don&#39;t even like the Avatar series but from what i&#39;m hearing 10 minutes into the video so far isn&#39;t a sufficient enough criticism as to why the movies aren&#39;t that good. It also completely ignores the main allegorical take which is that of the evils of colonialism. Regardless of how &quot;primitive&quot; or savage you think tribes of the old age are what happened back then is no less of an atrocity. The same is being said in these movies, so focusing on how the Navi are portrayed to stand on a higher moral ground than the humans just comes off as very insecure. With that being said i&#39;m only 10 minutes in so let&#39;s hope you explain yourself better."

The can talk to ancestors trough the interconnected organism that makes up the spirit trees, they can literally interface with the wildlife for goodness sake, do you seriously not understand how that level of connection to the things around you cause ones society to differ, how that sort of understanding would foster empathy and care for nature?<br><br>I will say, the Navi are put on a pedestal at times, the shaman scene is particularly bad. But I feel that a lot of your complaints are simply a misunderstanding of their society.<br><br>And the complaints that the humans are all bad and the only ones that aren&#39;t defect, like do the defectors not count???????? And what about the marine biologist in the second movie, he doesn&#39;t want to do any of this but what is his choice, he has to work, and the only other option is to walk out into the wilderness and die I guess, and if he was given the opportunity to defect, then you&#39;d be like &quot;oh that doesn&#39;t count because he has to remain on the human side&quot;.<br><br>Like have your opinion on the movies, but if you are gonna analyze it and claim to be objective then you have done a seriously shoddy job, full of strawmen, poor representation, selective evidence and what I can only assume is a genuine failure to understand the setting."

The navi are the indians and the people are the brits and the french who came there to colonise. The movie isnt made to be super creative in this regard, but I wouldnt say that it made the story bland or unconciously dislikable to us. It was a pretty normal story that you can see in many movies, but done really well, in a way in which most people can connect to it and enjoy it. After all, this is a blockbuster which has other goals in mind than making a revolutionary storyline. I think the first movie is really done well, and the second one is the one to talk about and explore bcs the decisions taken there are much more interesting and have mixed results."

Fantastic movies. If he had shown some problematic disadvantages to the Na&#39;vi faction these messages would become way less clear. It is art and storytellers are dramatists.

The difference between them and us, is that Navis have a Godess that exists, and her role is to keep that balance in nature, her existence is a fact and they can communicate with her.  So yeah, ofc they harmonise. To be honest i dont understand why everyone misses that. Its just in front of your eyes, one of the first things that the plot explains.

An idea that will likely be explored in future movies as Cameron has stated himself.<br>Ironically, this video talks about straw manning quite a bit, but seemed to be employing that very tactic.

        "Comments snippet-text": "my biggest gripe with the movies is humans fighting with navis and losing.. two times.. like hello? just nuke them from orbit, or release some navid19 virus on them so we can avoid damaging the natural resources while getting rid of navis, there are so many ways or humans to win since they are basically scifi aliens going against blue cavemen. In fact it would be much cheaper to nuke them than to make a bunch of avatars that cost like what? many billions each?"

        "Comments snippet-text": "A movie that does a better job at portraying an environmentalist theme and indigenous people is Princess Mononoke. The indigenous character San is a complex character, and so is the main antagonist Lady Eboshi. Lady Eboshi isn&#39;t bloodthirsty but does what she believes is right for the town she leads. San isn&#39;t a perfect person, she&#39;s distrusting of humans and aggressive, but she is still someone that viewers sympathize with and a beloved character by many (myself included). The thing that makes it work is that the antagonist and her town is endangered by something she does that harms an important nature spirit, and she is forced to change her ways. This works because many viewers like Eboshi, she genuinely wants the best for her town and people want to imagine how she improves once the movie ends."
